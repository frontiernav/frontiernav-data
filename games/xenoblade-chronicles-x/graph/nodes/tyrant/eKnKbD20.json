    "notes": "\"Jarosch, the Sensational\" very rarely spawns in place of a Jade Saltat on the large and very noticeable bunch of red/pink flowers growing on the large arching tree in the middle of Rustpool Bank. The spawning distance is so short that you have to land directly on the flower and then wait for several seconds before the game loads the Jade Saltat/Jarosch into the world. Instead of reloading the entire area with fast travel/return to Skell it will be faster to fly straight up until the Jade Saltat despawns and then drop down so the game loads it into the gameworld again and rerolls the dice on which creature is loaded.",
