    "notes": "\"Sven, the Sturdy\" is on what I dub to be crab island out in the ocean to the west of Primordia (south of Noctilum). Sven is indeed very sturdy and reduces all incoming attacks to just 1 point of damage thanks to having Attribute Resistances of 100 for every element. Moves that reduce/ignore resistances will tear through those defences (e.g. Ares super weapon, Blossom Dance Art, etc). A Mech 5 treasure on the same island contains FILE-USP0460ME, the level 50 Trident-Anchor Skell weapon schematic.",
