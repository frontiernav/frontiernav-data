    "notes": "\"Lugalbanda, the Wanderer-King\" lives in a secret side passage within vitriol cesspool, a cave trying to live up to its name in a literal sense that is located south of Serpentines Pass in Noctilum (alternatively fast travel to FN Site 209 and follow the foul water into the cave). Once inside the cave head into the water and swim through a small crack on the leftside (southside) of the caves main room, at the end of the long tunnels through this crack stands Lugalbanda.",
