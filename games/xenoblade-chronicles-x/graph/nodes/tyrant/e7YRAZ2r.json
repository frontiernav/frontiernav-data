    "notes": "\"Dadaan, the Strongest Prone\" can be found gracing Mira with his magnificent physical form over at the Scablands Fortress in south west Oblivia. He is protected by the Dadaan Girls who will taunt party members to pull attention away from Dadaan and he will also enter invincibility periods in order to flex while a zergrush of Dadaan Squad Members will be summoned to fight the party. Easy to beat with a Skell superweapon but a fun challenge on foot.",
