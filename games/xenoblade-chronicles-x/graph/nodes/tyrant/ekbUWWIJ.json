One would normally avoid such an imposing enemy however it has the unfortunate luck of sitting right on top of a teleporter that is the only entrance to a nearby floating platform containing the one of a kind \"Reflect: Ether\" augment (only other source for this augment in the game is a level 99 Tyrant who also happens to use a lot of Ether attacks).",
